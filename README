This is the first client for mapitprices.com

It was specifically designed to handle only one category from the main site, namely beer!

The idea was to try and solve some of the user experience issues with a small category of price/map data in order to make the entering/updating of prices as efficient as possible.

In terms of ease of use, I'm mainly completing with Excel so if my application is more difficult to add/update there had better be a pay off.  In this case mapping/searching and eventually shopping list was supposed to be that pay off.
